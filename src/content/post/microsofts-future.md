The fact that Apple has overtaken Microsoft to be a more profitable, I feel is a good thing.

If Microsoft becomes second to Google and second to Apple.  Doesn’t that allow Microsoft to return to the aggressive company that it was in the early days?  Of course the have to do this a competitive and lawful manner.

Microsoft has been held back by regulation in both the US and the EU because of fears of regulation.  Can Baller do this or does Gates need to return?
