I really like my iPhone, there are a few things that need to be there, my list has reduced some what since version 3.0.

My iPhone has 3 email accounts, 2 Gmail and 1 Exchange.  I would like the number of messages to have different colours so you knew visually how many emails in each account.  Also if there is email in more than one account the when select email I want it to go to the email account list rather than the last used. Also if there is only 1 email in any of the 3 accounts then just go to the account inbox with the 1 email.

My Exchange/Outlook account has lots of folders and their is no way to collapse the folders and it takes lots of swipes to get to the sent items folder.

And of course multitasking…… :-)
