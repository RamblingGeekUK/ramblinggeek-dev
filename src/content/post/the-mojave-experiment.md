[The "Mojave Experiment"](https://www.mojaveexperiment.com/)

This is part of Microsoft's comeback marketing for Vista.Â  All we need now are these videos to be shown on TV for a period of a few weeks talking about Mojave and then reviled them that it's Vista and then talk about the features.

I like this, much better than I'm a PC and I'm a Mac.......
