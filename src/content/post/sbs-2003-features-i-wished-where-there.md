It would be cool when you logged into RWW and clicked on the Connect to my computer at work that as well as showing you the computer name it displayed the computer description, also whether a user was logged in, if the PC was powered down this was displayed via a icon, which could be clicked on to start the PC up via a Wake-on-LAN command.

Typing this has got me thinking if I could amend the page myself.......
