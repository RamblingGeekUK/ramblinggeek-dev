This year started so fast I’m still catching up with myself.  ![Smile](https://ramberlinggeek.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/wlEmoticon-smile.png)

The new job has been really hectic and home life hasn’t been much different.   Lisa and I have been getting to all those jobs that have been put off and are making good progress.  However once you start on the jobs around the house you always seem to find more. ![Smile](https://ramberlinggeek.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/wlEmoticon-smile.png)

I’ve just looked it up and I can’t believe that I moved this blog from word press hosted to self hosted more than a year ago.

That said with how busy things have been of late not had much time to blog, hence the silence.

Just a short post to let you all know that I’m still here and I shall try to be more active going forward.

It’s not like there hasn’t been anything to blog about, mini-iPhone, Nokia and Microsoft, HP and WebOS, Microsoft Signature (US Only), SBS 20011, Faulty Intel SATA chipset!!!!

I am still keeping my ear to the ground, just not  had time to post.  I’m not one for just blogging the same on stuff you see, I’ll like to add my experience/my own thoughts.

Anyhow I try and do better going forward….. until next time.
