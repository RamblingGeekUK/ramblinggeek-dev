I purchased one of these and received early this week.  I'm very happy with it.

It feel nice in the hand and the it comes with a leather case.   It doesn't re-flow PDF's all that well as they are formatted for A4 size paper, but there more than readable.

It would be nice for companies to provide PDF's formatted for the unit. Other than that I'm very happy.
