This was/is one of the strangest issues that I have ever come across.  You try to connect to remote server and it does connect and the following error message is returned. 

_Your Computer can't connect to the remote computer because a security package error occurred in transport layer._

After a recent windows update the cached credentials no longer work.

To fix the issue delete/clear the cached credentials under the remote gateway settings.
