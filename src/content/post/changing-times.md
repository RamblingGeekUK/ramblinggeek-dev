I havenâ€™t had the chance to post much of lot as a lot has been going on. Unfortunately at this time, I canâ€™t speak about it just yet. Most of my time has been consumed with family affairs and working on an ASP.NET web application.

I will blog more about the experiences that I have had developing the database over the coming weeks.

Sorry to be vague, but I just thought I needed to post something so you know that I was still active.Â ðŸ™‚
