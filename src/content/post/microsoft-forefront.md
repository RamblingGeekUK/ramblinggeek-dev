I’ve spent a little time looking at Microsoft Forefront as Microsoft Security Essentials is so good I wanted to know what the “professional” tools brought…

The management software has very odd requirements:-

- Needs to be Windows Server 2008 R2
- Not a Domain Controller
- Configuration Manager 2007

Which is great for enterprise but doesn’t fit Microsoft Small Business Product in anyway, where’s forefront for SBS?

Here’s a screen grab from Microsoft Security Essentials.

Here’s a screen grab from Forefront Client.

Spot the difference, the name.  This is great because the free MSE client is so good it means forefront is just as good.   They downside is requirements for management are to high for small businesses, which is a shame because this could be a killer product.
