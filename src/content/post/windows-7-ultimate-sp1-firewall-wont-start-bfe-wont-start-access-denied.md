I was working on a PC and the firewall would not start it had been infected by malware, I had cleaned it up but it still wouldn't start. After some Bing'ing :-) Â  I came across this utility of Eset. [https://kb.eset.com/library/ESET/KB%20Team%20Only/Malware/ServicesRepair.exe](https://kb.eset.com/library/ESET/KB%20Team%20Only/Malware/ServicesRepair.exe "ServicesRepair.exe")

Download it and ran it and all started working as you would expect. :-)
