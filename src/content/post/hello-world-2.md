I have been away on my Holidays of late…. hence why it’s been quiet on here. So here’s a brief summary of things I'm playing around with and an update.  ![Smile](https://ramberlinggeek.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/wlEmoticon-smile.png)

I’m looking in to Android development.  I’ve not really bothered with Linux all that much.  So I expect that I’ll end up about my experiences with Android in the coming months.

I also want to look at Windows Phone 7 Development and maybe even launch an app.  Will have to see ![Smile](https://ramberlinggeek.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/wlEmoticon-smile.png)

In August, I was mentioning a big change coming for me and if you have looked at my About page then you will already know.  We sold our company Total ICT Limited.   Which took a few weeks to get things sorted. 

This move will hopefully improve things for me personally going forward.
