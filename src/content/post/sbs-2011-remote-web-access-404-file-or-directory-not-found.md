My first instinct when I first seen this error, was to restart IIS on the server, which I did. Still didn't resolve the issue. Opened up chrome and it worked no issue.

This issue is with Internet Explorer 11 and not IIS. I had to add the external URL in the IE Compatibility View Settings and the page displays now with no errors.

Very annoying issue, when your using all products from one vendor.
