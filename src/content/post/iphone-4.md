I haven’t purchased an iPhone 4 for two reasons.

1\. 24 month contract

2\. The antenna issue.

I don’t want to commit to a 24 month contract when apple will almost be refreshing again next summer and why would I want to purchase a expensive phone which may be faulty from the go?

So it looks like I may well jump this generation, because of these two issues I will be looking with some interest at Windows Phone 7 when it releases around October time.

Time will tell.
