I'm developing a web application on asp.net and I wanted to know what URL I was running on, for example, www.domain.com. I hate hard coding things or making assumptions. Also when uploading to different servers, it would mean things should just work and we all like it when things do just work.🙂

```c#
Request.Url.GetLeftPart(UriPartial.Authority)
```

Always so simple, when you know how.
