So if you have been coming to my site for a little while, firsitly thank you. You have noticed big changes here. I have moved away from WordPress and moved to using astro framework. In the process of moving it became obvious to me I wanted to impove this site and it's content. 

So with that in mind you will notice that the previous post are not visible.  I have done this for two reasons, the first being the quaility of a lot of the posts weren't great many of them should of been tweets. However in the intrest of not breaking things as much as possible the links out there on the web will still work.   I hope this is a good compermise of moving forward with better content and keeping the old posts avaible.
