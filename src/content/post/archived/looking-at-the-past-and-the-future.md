It’s been a week of anniversary’s. This past week, [Windows XP](https://www.engadget.com/2011/10/25/windows-xp-turns-10-enjoys-its-golden-years-and-slow-transition/) and [Apple’s iPod](https://www.engadget.com/2011/10/23/the-ipod-turns-10-celebrates-a-decade-of-destroying-physical-me/) both turned 10 years old.  I’m amazed how much has changed in the last 10 years.

Windows XP is Microsoft’s best operating system to date, Windows 7 has only just recently taken over [Windows XP installed base.](https://www.engadget.com/2011/10/15/windows-7-overtakes-xp-globally-vista-found-weeping-in-a-corner/)  So I guess it really is time to upgrade if your using Windows XP to read this.

[Apple](https://www.engadget.com/2010/05/26/apple-and-microsoft-now-neck-and-neck-in-market-capitalization/) is now a bigger company than Microsoft and Steve Jobs is no longer with us. It’s then may be perhaps fitting that Microsoft has also released a video looking into the future.
