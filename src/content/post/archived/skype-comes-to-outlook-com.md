Skype is coming to Outlook.com in the UK today.   More information can be found over on the outlook.com [blog](https://blogs.office.com/b/microsoft-outlook/archive/2013/04/29/skype-comes-to-outlook-com.aspx). I really like outlook.com since switching from gmail a couple of weeks ago. I think this is great news.

It's also great to see Microsoft updating it's products more and more regularly these days and long may it continue.
