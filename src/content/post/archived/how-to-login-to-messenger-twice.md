Logging in to Windows Live Messenger using separate accounts.

I’ve been looking for a way to do this a the last couple of months.  Why would I want to do this?  Well when I’m at home in the evening I want friends to see me and I don’t mind work colleagues being to contact me.  ![Smile](https://ramberlinggeek.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/wlEmoticon-smile1.png)

I mentioned this to a work colleague that he told me about A-Patch (Google it).  Which works.  Even thou it appears to have some dubious links.   I’ve tried it on various PC’s and it appears fine.

Trust me one of these in my personal account and the other is my work account.
