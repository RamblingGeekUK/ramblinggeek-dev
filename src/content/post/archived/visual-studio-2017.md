So I decided to install Visual Studio 2017. I have a 128GB SSD that I purchased a few years back now, and I know I'm due an upgrade. ðŸ™‚

I wanted to play around with the Xamarin bits. So I selected what I wanted and it came to 40GB'ish, no problem I have a 1TB mechanical HDD.. so I changed the install location to D:\\ drive.

As you can see from the screenshot above, I have selected D: drive and you can see the Android SDK bits selected to be installed top right.

So I click install and it failed with a disk space error. What the installer doesn't make you aware off is the Android SDK bits are installed on the C: drive!

![](/images/VS2017-Andriod-SDK.png)As you can see the SDK grabbed 10Gb of the C: drive. Â 

So there you go, make sure you have disk space available on your C: drive.

The most frustrating thing is a little warning would save a lot of wasted time.

I have logged this on the user's voice after tweeting Visual Studio.
