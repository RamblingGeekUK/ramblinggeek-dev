Yesterday I spoke about losing data at a customer's site. Well, it was indeed lost.Â Which wasn't great as you can imagine. Thankfully the customer was very understanding all things considered.

We managed to partially restore some data into the database and reset the stock values, it's now down to them to carry out a stock take and update those values and they should be up and running again, albeit, without any history, I do suspect that it was all a little too easy and I think as time goes on that there will be more problems with this site because of this, I am hoping to be proved wrong.

So I left the site feeling that we had done all we could have done in a bad situation, so hopefully, this will be chalked up to experience for all concerned.

This is the second post in as many days, I have no idea what's going on! ðŸ™‚ At this moment in time, I'm finding blogging therapeutic.Â I know many won't understand why, but in true geek style, I don't care.

I think the other reason, I've started blogging this week as I'm hoping to blog about our wedding and adventures in Florida in the coming weeks, I'm not sure when or even if I'm going to have time to blog every single day, but I'm going to do my best, assuming the future wife will allow it! :-)

It's funny once I start typing I start to want to talk about all kinds of stuff, I have just been reading [Paul Thurrott's blog](https://www.winsupersite.com/) about [Amazon's Kindle](https://www.winsupersite.com/reviews/kindle.asp) after reading that, I wish I had one for the flights for the coming weeks, as I've found in the past few years that I enjoyed reading and I think this device sounds quite useful and it would be a new gadget to play with of course :-)Â  As usual, it's not available in the UK as of yet, just like the Zune!

It is of course difficult knowing how much to share on a public blog,I guess I will have to buy [Scoble's](https://scobleizer.com/) [book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/047174719X?tag=nakedconversa-20&camp=14573&creative=327641&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=047174719X&adid=0KYBWJPM4FHMFHGHMXYP&) about blogging.... to see what insights I can get.

I'm using Microsoft's [Windows Live Writer](https://get.live.com/writer/overview) to blog this and I must say, I'm loving it!
