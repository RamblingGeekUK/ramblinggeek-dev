A client recently required Windows Server 2008 server, they already[![imagesCAHQZN50](https://ramblinggeek.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/imagesCAHQZN50_thumb.jpg "imagesCAHQZN50")](https://ramblinggeek.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/imagesCAHQZN50.jpg) had Windows Sever 2008 R1, with Hyper-v installed and required an additional server.

So we ordered a copy of Windows Server 2008 R2 for their additional sever requirements.  Upon receiving this copy the license sticker got me intrigued. It had both a physical product key and a virtual product key.

The performance benefits that come with Windows Server 2008 r2 for hyper-v are more than worth while.

So could we use these product keys to install Windows Server 2008 R2 and use the virtual key as intend and get the Windows Server 2008 R2 performance benefits?

It appears you can!  Take a look at this extract:

> _Q. If I have one license for Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard and want to run it in a virtual operating system environment, can I continue running it in the physical operating system environment?_
> 
> _A. Yes, with Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard, you may run one instance in the physical operating system environment and one instance in the virtual operating system environment; however, the instance running in the physical operating system environment may be used only to run hardware virtualization software, provide hardware virtualization services, or to run software to manage and service operating system environments on the licensed server._
