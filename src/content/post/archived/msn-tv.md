Microsoft has launched MSN TV in the UK, which is great even ad supported the more methods we have watching content legally the better.

When I first heard about this on PC Pro’s news when site the surprise was that it was based on flash rather than silverlight.

Indeed this is odd, when I used the website for the first time the quality isn’t the best.  So is the thinking behind it along the lines of we have now updated with silverlight because its' better quality  with it’s adaptive streaming.
