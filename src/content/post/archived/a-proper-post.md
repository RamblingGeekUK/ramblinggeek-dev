I haven’t done a “proper” post on here in a while. There’s been a lot going on for me, moving house and having a poorly baby boy, he’s well now.

That’s not to say I’ve not been keeping in touch with the latest news, as you may have noticed, I did post some videos of Windows Phone.

There’s so much going on at the moment from Windows 8, Windows 2012, SQL Server, Office 2013, Xbox Dashboard update and of course, Microsoft has released there own tablet, the Microsoft Surface RT and I have purchased one, which deserves its post, for my thoughts on that device.

So lots of software and devices to install and play around with and of course there are the SDKs to take a look at as well.

There was also the shock announcement from Microsoft, regarding the departure of Sinofsky, just weeks after Windows 8 shipped, from what I have watched and read this appears to be the correct move for Microsoft.

Apple releases the iPad Mini as well as updated most of its products, including a New iPad just a few months after the last update.

The Nexus range of devices from Google, with the [Nexus 10](https://www.pcpro.co.uk/reviews/tablets/378280/nexus-10) looks like a very compelling product.

Then there’s the crazy situation with [John McAfee](https://www.whoismcafee.com/watchfulness/) and HP’s write-down on UK company Autonomy.

I feel like I’m just scratching the surface (no pun intended), of what's been going on lately. So as you can see I’m still here and I’ve not gone inactive.

Once I start to sit down and look at this stuff more posts will appear regularly again.
