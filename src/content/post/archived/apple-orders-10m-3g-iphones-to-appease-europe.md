[Apple "orders 10m 3G iPhones" to appease Europe"](https://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/181827/apple-orders-10m-3g-iphones-to-appease-europe.html)

When Apple announced that it would be bringing support to Exchange ActiveSync to the iPhone, I'll admit I was tempted, after a little thought though, I would be giving up the following.

1. £250
2. 3G/HSPA Support
3. Our Orange contract allows us to make free calls to each other on our business plan

So if this is true, and until Apple announces it, it isn't. Then that would be two of my 3 ticked.  If Apple wants to increase sales, they should allow us to purchase from whatever supplier we like.....
