So my wish is getting closer... see [here](https://www.engadget.com/2008/06/09/steve-jobs-keynote-live-from-wwdc-2008/).Â  Although I think I'm going to have to wait at least two years for the O2 and Apple deal to come to an end before I'll get my final wish of Orange selling the iPhone... hopefully in that time HTC will be kicking butt with their devices.

Looking back at my recent posts, I've done nothing other than talk about the iPhone......
