I don't blog as much as I should. I've just installed the latest Windows Live Writer Beta, which is why I'm blogging now.

The interesting thing is, I feel like I'm talking to myself. As I don't feel people are reading my blog.

Live writer has a link icon to the status of your blog which I've just clicked. People are reading! Even thou it looks to me as if there trying to find info out, but that's fine by me.

So maybe I will blog more in the future.

Cool! It updates the post rather than creating a new one. :-)
