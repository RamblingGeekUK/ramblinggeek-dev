I missed my self imposed deadline.  :-(

iConfig is now up and running, shall we call it in Beta, it's not perfect and there is a lot more I could do.  I wanted to get this out in the world and draw a line under it and if people like it then I shall invest more time into it.

You can play around with it at [iconfig.kryptos.co.uk](https://iconfig.kryptos.co.uk).  If you do have a play, then please do let me know your thoughts.
