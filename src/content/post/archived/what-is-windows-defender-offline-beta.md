Microsoft Security Essentials in my opinion is one the best anti virus products to be released in years.   Version 2.0 is currently in beta and Microsoft have now released a offline version which can be booted from USB, CD/DVD.

This is great, you can download from [here](https://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/what-is-windows-defender-offline).
