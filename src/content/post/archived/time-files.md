Wow, I can’t believe it’s been 10 days since I last blogged.   It’s a good job that I didn’t join in with BEDA (Blog Everyday in August). 

Anyhow, I still have lots of stuff going on and I have some bad news.  A family member has passed away.  She was only 46.  I lost my Mum 8 Years ago and other friends and family (didn’t want to list them all as it’s all ready a tough post).   This really brings home, the question what’s it’s all about.  In reality we don’t know.  The important thing is to figure out what makes you happy and do it. 

After reflecting over the last week thinking about my life, I’m good, I feel like I’m happy overall, I’m really glad to say.  I think one area I need to work on is my motivation for doing things around the house and work, rather than just thinking about doing stuff I need to start doing stuff. ![Smile](https://ramberlinggeek.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/wlEmoticonsmile1.png)

I just wanted to put another post up as I’m aware that I’ve been quite of late. 

Until next time.
