Late last year I purchased a new PC, in fact a new motherboard, processor, memory.   Since I built I've had an issue, the 2nd monitor on my dual screen configuration wouldn't wake up.  I ensured I had the latest drivers at the time, which didn't resolved the issue.   I had another luck the other day and noticed that more recent drivers had been released in December! :-)

So I downloaded and installed.   It appears that the issue had been resolved.  The chip set is using the Intel HD Graphics 4400, (I don't play games :p).   I've posted this as I couldn't find any information on the web regarding it.
