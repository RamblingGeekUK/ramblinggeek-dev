I was asked to install a printer for a user.  No problem, so I browsed to the server and right clicked the printer and selected connect, then I was presented with a dialogue with the following message, "The credentials supplied conflict with an existing set".

So I Googled around and came across various links, such as this [one](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/197987) and this [one](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itpronetworking/thread/fbf4319c-b24a-4952-9a62-5e15ebd151df).  Then I noticed that I couldn't open the printer by just double clicking the share, when doing the same to others printers worked OK.

I checked the settings on the server an the user didn't have access rights to print to that printer.  I added the user and all started working as expected. :-)
