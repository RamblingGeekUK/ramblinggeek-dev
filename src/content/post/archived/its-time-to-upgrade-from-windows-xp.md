If you haven't moved from Windows XP then it's time to make the move.  April 8th 2014, there will be no support any longer for Windows XP.   Windows XP is currently in Extended Support and it won't be extended again.

So it's time to look at those internal applications running and ensure the work with Windows 7 and maybe even Windows 8.
