In this [post](https://ramblinggeek.co.uk/2012/03/windows-8-hyperv-and-slat/), I talk about the requirement of Windows 8, Hyper-V to have hardware support for SLAT.  This appears not to be the case with Windows Server 2012 as Hyper-V can be installed without the SLAT support.   As I have installed it and Hyper-V and all works fine. I’m not sure Microsoft has changed this requirement or if I simply misunderstood in the first place At least I don’t have to invest in new hardware straight away.
