I have found a few spare moments to welcome 2015, at least I have managed to post this in January at least.  I pretty much said it all in my 2014 post.

More of the same really, I have many posts in Draft, which I'm keen to finish and get posted. I intended to do more videos to flesh out the posts. I feel that video helps when people are trying to follow, I will post the videos here and of course on my YouTube channel.

I have also brought back ads. Sorry, I need the site to start paying its way. It would also be nice to have a little pocket money, to allow me to purchase more gadgets, such as the Zalman (2.5” USB3.0 External HDD Case).

This is a case with a difference, you create a folder on the drive called "_iso" and drop bootable ISO's and you can boot from it via USB, the case, presents itself as a USB CD-ROM drive, which is pretty awesome, it's yet to fail me on all of the devices that I have tried it on.

I have dropped in a 2.5" drive, but I'm tempted to swap this out for an SSD as installs would fly. Take a look at [https://www.zalman.com/global/product/Product\_Read.php?Idx=674](https://www.zalman.com/global/product/Product_Read.php?Idx=674).

Reading this back, the Zalman text looks like a hidden Ad, I assure you it's not. Found it on Amazon one day and bought it. It has to be my best gadget purchase of at least 2014!

Until next time folks!
