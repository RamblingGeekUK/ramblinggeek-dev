I was getting a lot of these errors in the system event log on one of the servers we maintain.

This thread put me on the right track to resolving the problem, [https://www.daniweb.com/forums/thread39730.html](https://www.daniweb.com/forums/thread39730.html)

1. Go to Start > Programs > Administrative Tools > Component Services  

2. Expand the Component Services > Computers > My Computer > DCOM Config (I received an error at this point, I clicked no)

3. I then change the view to details which displayed the Application ID. I went thru until I found the application id that matched that in the event viewer.

4. Click on the Identity Tab. On that tab, there is a "This **user**:" radio button which contains the username and password that my Component is using. Simply change the **user** login information, you may have to restart the machine.

Hope it helps :-)

UPDATE: Corrected a few typoâ€™s. ðŸ™‚
