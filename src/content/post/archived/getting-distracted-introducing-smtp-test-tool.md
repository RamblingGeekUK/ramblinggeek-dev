Like I don't have enough projects going on, yet to be completed but coming along nicely.

Working on networks and trying to prove SMTP is working through firewalls etc.. Most people just use Telnet, which is fine until you want to send an email, sure you can send an email via telnet. This can be a pain when you want to send many tests or you make a typo in telnet.  So I quickly threw this together the other night. The RG SMTP Test Tool.  I'm just putting a few finishing touches and building an installer and I shall release (hopefully) at the weekend.
