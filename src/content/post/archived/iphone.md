Blogging with iPhone. Yes I have bought one, well three as it happens. We have moved from orange to o2, it acutally worked out cheaper per month.

So far the iPhone has impressed me a lot.

After spending years using windows mobiles, touchscreen versions.

After using the iPhone, I have come to realisation that I was trying to use a device designed with a screen for use with a stylus.

Were as the iPhone is designed with touch in mind.

I've typed this on the iPhone with a fair speed and accracey.
