I spent some time this morning cleaning up the broken areas of this site.

The tabs plugin I was using in the Toolbox area wasn't working and I've yet to figure out why or find one that I like, so, for the time being, I have returned to the list format. Nice and simple.

The "What's My IP Plugin" stopped working, there was a naming conflict. I've now resolved this and submitted it to the WordPress Plugin Directory, which should prevent it from happening in the future. I have also moved it from "Incubator" to the "Toolbox" menu as it's completed.

I'm not getting around to posting as much as I would like and I do have things I would like to post, lots of articles started and unfinished. I've been busy of late with family and work life and any spare time that I have had has been used catching up on the latest going on around Windows 10 and ASP.NET.

Thanks for reading and if you have any suggestions or notice any issues with the site then please do use the contact form and let me know.

Until next time, Happy Computing. ðŸ™‚
