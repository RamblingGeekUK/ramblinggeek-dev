I've been reading the new Microsoft Blog from the head of the Windows Team who's starting talking a little about Windows 7.

[https://blogs.msdn.com/e7/](https://blogs.msdn.com/e7/ "https://blogs.msdn.com/e7/")

There are various comments about customising the look and feel of Vista and Windows 7 when it comes.Â 

Apple doesn't let you make much more if any changes to the design of OS X and I don't hear people complaining why is that?
