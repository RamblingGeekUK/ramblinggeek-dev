I'm intrigued by Microsoft's new browser, Spartan. Here's the first video (as far as I'm aware) of it. It looks nice and I'm hoping the hate for IE will die along with the browser. I want this to be a hit for Microsoft, for this to happen they need to do two things.

It needs to support add-ins, I love the fact that I can have an SSH client with Chrome. Microsoft has said it's coming, I hope it comes sooner rather than later.

Release it for Windows 7, if they don't do this then it's a massive mistake, just release it without Windows 10 features like Cortana.

I think this looks nice!
