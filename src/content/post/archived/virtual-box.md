So I came across Sun’s Virtual Box software some time ago and tried booting a 64bit OS on it which at the time seemed a little buggy.

I decided that  I would give it another go and it seems to just work….. and running on Windows 7 as well. :-)

See for yourself…..

So if Sun can do this and give it a way for free, why can’t Microsoft enable Windows Virtual PC to have 64bit support?
