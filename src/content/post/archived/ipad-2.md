Ok, welcome back.  I’ve had a change of heart or I’ve been sucked into Steve Job’s reality distortion field.

The problem is, I love my iPhone.   The thought of having a bigger iPhone to use whilst sitting in the living room appeals to me because using my laptop I end up getting very uncomfortable and if I should/need to be doing real work then, I should be in my study.

in that the iPad will fit the causal usage perfect as my iPhone does now, thus the thought of the bigger screen and the 10 hours battery time apply so much.  The problem for HP’s slate is that it going to have approx 5+ hours of battery time and it’s going to be running a full version of Windows 7.  I think that’s were the issue lies, Windows 7 is designed for slate use and the iPad is because it’s based on the iPhone OS and with the forth coming version of iPhone 4.0 and multitasking will be enabled, which removes one of the drawbacks, but most techie people don’t care about multitasking any how.

Anyhow, it looks like I'm going to end up buying one…  :-)
