I’ve been a Daddy for a month.   Sure has gone really fast.  Not had much time for geeky software of late between the day job and being at the hospital in the evenings and the weekends.

  
Ethan should be home soon.  So I should be able to find some time in the evenings and hopefully the weekends whilst he and mummy are sleeping.
