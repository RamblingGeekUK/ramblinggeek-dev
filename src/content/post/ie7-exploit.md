Microsoft announced this week of an “Huge increase” in IE attacks.  More information can be obtain from [here](https://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/242970/microsoft-sees-huge-increase-in-ie-attacks.html).

If Microsoft doesn’t release this information to the public then it will be accused of not doing enough.

At the same time this news has been aired on the national radio station here in the UK.  The report basically said don’t use IE, it didn’t explain the issue.

Which I feel will only cause panic or a knee-jerk reaction.

Sites effected are related to porn sites and **could** be used on a legitimate sites. 

Legitimate companies should be aware of this issue and doing all they can to help prevent the attacks, this is the point were people say it’s Microsoft’s software it’s there responsibility, my response to that would be, security is everybody's responsibility.

Today Microsoft will be releasing a fix outside of Patch Tuesday schedule via Microsoft Update. [Link](https://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/243393/microsoft-pushes-emergency-patch-for-internet-explorer.html).
