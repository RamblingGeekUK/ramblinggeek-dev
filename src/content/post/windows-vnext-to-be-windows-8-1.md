It would appear the next version of Windows, which is currently code named "Blue" is going to Windows 8.1, at least according to [Mary Jo Foley](https://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft) and [Paul Thurrott](https://www.winsupersite.com/).

With this new information you would have to think that's it going to be a free update via Windows Update.
