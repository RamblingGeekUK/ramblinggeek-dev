I've been reading the following posts from Paul Thurrott.

Paul doesn't seem to link to the actual D9 video for some reason, so I thought I would here to allow people to make up their own mind.

EDIT:Â  He does. :-)

Microsoft Windows President Steven Sinofsky unveiled the new look of Windows at D9. Here's the video. June 20, 2011
