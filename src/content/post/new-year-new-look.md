I thought I would start the New Year with a fresh look to the site as the previous site was looking a bit old, it's the first real refresh in two years.   I've gone for a Metro/Windows 8/Modern UI feel.  I hope you like it, please feel free to leave any feedback that you may have.

Lots of exciting technology to play with... err work with, Windows Server 2012, Exchange 2013, Android, Mac OS x, Windows Phone 8, Windows 8.   I have been busy the last couple of evenings rebuilding the lab so I can play around with all of these exciting technologies.
