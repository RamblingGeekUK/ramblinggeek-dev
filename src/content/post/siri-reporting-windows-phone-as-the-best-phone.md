Yesterday I saw a tweet from @appleboyy with a screen shot of a iPhone’s Siri function displaying Windows Phone as the best selling phone.  I tried this myself and it indeed did the same.

Today that it’s now change for different response, but doesn't query wolfram Alpha any longer.

Demo of the change functionality of Siri since yesterday.

**UPDATE: You have to say, "What's the best cell phone, ever"**
