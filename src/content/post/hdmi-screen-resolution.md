I plugged my Laptop into my TV (42” Sharp 1080i) and I received this: -

As you can see the taskbar and the left edge aren’t visible, after playing around with screen resolution and not getting anywhere I decided to take a look at my remote.  I found an option which allowed me to put the TV into under scan which resolved this issue.[![Iphone 014](https://ramberlinggeek.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/iphone014_thumb.jpg "Iphone 014")](https://ramberlinggeek.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/iphone014.jpg)  [![Iphone 015](https://ramberlinggeek.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/iphone015_thumb.jpg "Iphone 015")](https://ramberlinggeek.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/iphone015.jpg)

Problem fixed, I searched for this and didn’t come across that much that helped….. so I hope this does. :-)
