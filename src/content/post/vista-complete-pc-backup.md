I purchase a [WD MyBook](https://www.wdc.com/en/products/products.asp?driveid=353) USB drive…. which I have to say I’m liking so far…. Cheapist £50 for 300GB…

Any how I ran Vista Complete PC Backup, Last night, which creates a VHD image of you PC’s HDD.

It doesn’t boot, but you can add it to existing Virtual PC as a second drive and you can access it!

Good stuff to know for any further format and reinstall’s…. although I shouldn’t have to worry about it much longer as I ordered a [HP EX470](https://www.shopping.hp.com/product/notebook/notebook_hp/home_servers/1/accessories/GG795AA%2523ABA;HHOJSID=2gGsLjtJwM8zGlV3q2BMZfzF8hHjyLr9Tm6Bv5xkMbj6DXhRM5WG!353987858)!  500GB and I can add two more drives internally and external USB drives…

I wipe my PC on a fairly regular basis, just installed Vista 64 bit, with 8GB Ram and virtual machines flying with the VHD’s on the [WD MyBook](https://www.wdc.com/en/products/products.asp?driveid=353)……

So I think I’ll have plenty of storage expansion for the future.
