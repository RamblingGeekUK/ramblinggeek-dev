Images Lost. Sorry ☹️

I was browsing the app store last night on my iPad and it closed. I reopened it again and I had the US app store.  As you can see from the screen grabs, I could see hulu, so I tried to install, it started downloaded and a message came up saying I couldn’t use that store for my country and then it switched back.
