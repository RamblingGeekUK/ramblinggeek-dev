Just reading on the Windows Team Blog, that we are indeed going to be able to purchase the Windows 7 Family Pack here in the UK.

This will allow 3 PC’s to be upgraded in the home.  This is good news, however the bad news, is that’s it’s only going to be on sale for a limited period, this should be on sale full stop.
