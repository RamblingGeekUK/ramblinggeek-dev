These errors can be misleading and cause you go off on a tangent....  Check the local profile cache size on the PC.  You do this by doing the following: -

1\. Open Control Panel 2. Open Sync Center 3. Click Offline Files 4. Click Manage Offline Files (left hand side) 5. Click Disk Usage tab 6. Change Limits

Hope this has helped.
