VMWare player crashes when you try and run Virtual PC along side…. great.  When I try to open the VHD, it can’t convert.  So now I have to spend time installing Windows XP/Vista clients, which I already have into VMWare…..

I’m actually thinking of building a new PC to run Windows Server 2008 on so I can do X64 Vitalization, with more easy…. just don’t want another box and I’ve spent out on 8GB Ram….  Please MS updated virtual PC to allow x64 Guest’s.
